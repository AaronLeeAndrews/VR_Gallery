For some weird reason, the videos for the games need to have their own asset folder inside of the data folder, namely, they need to be inside of VS VR Gallery > Build > VRGamePreview_Data > Assets

Note that a new build will overwrite this folder, and it will need to be recreated each time.

Todo:
Write into the build that the folder is created.
